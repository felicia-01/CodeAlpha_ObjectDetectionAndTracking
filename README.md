# CodeAlpha_ObjectDetectionAndTracking
Real-time object detection and tracking using YOLOv11 and SORT. Processes webcam or video input with OpenCV, detects objects frame-by-frame, applies tracking with unique IDs, and displays results with labels in real time.

## üîç Real-Time Object Detection, Segmentation, Pose Estimation & Tracking

This project demonstrates a real-time computer vision system that performs **object detection**, **instance segmentation**, **pose estimation**, **object classification**, and **object tracking** using **YOLOv11** and **SORT**. It supports live webcam feeds and video file inputs, with output saved as video, image frames, and CSV logs.
